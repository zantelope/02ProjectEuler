Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

###!

recursion.py generates Fibonacci numbers using recursion: accurate, but very inefficient.

iteration.py solves using iteration: have a few variables that hold previous values used for finding next number in sequence. Much better.

not included yet, but researching problem introduced the idea of generators. Interesting. Look more into this and add solution involving them later.
